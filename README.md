**Indian Premier League**   
This project was opened initially to track and pridict for the IPL 2020. Now, we aim to take it forward for 2021 as well.  
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional **Twenty20** cricket league in India contested during March or **April** and April-May of every year by **eight teams** representing eight different cities or states in India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008.  
  
The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube.   
The **brand value** of the IPL in 2019 was **US$ 6.7 billions**, according to Duff & Phelps, the 2015 IPL season alone contributed US$160 million to the GDP of the Indian economy.   
  
There have been twelve seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL title holders are the **Mumbai Indians**, who won the 2019 season. The venue for the 2020 season has been moved, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; games will now take place in the United Arab Emirates from 19 September through 10 November.
